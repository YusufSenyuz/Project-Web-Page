        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>Our project handles the problem of house renting. Rents are regulated by our system. In our project, 
deposits of each rental apartment will be taken by the government. The government will
be able to earn money by using the collected deposits. With the implementation of the
project, rent problems such as exorbitant price increases and tenant-landlord disputes will
be solved.</p>
